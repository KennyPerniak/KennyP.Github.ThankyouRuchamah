        <P class="start">Since the first day of BC, you had always given us the time and resource to develop us young adults
            to become the men/women who can lead. I want to personally thank you for believing true that we can 
            become something great. It will be because of you, that we will find comfort in our future.<br><br>
            You had taught us many skills about be professional like sending emails, presenting, and team-work.
            You have continued to push us out of our comfort zone to shape us to the young adults you intended
            us to become. <br><br>
            Before giving your goodbyes and leaving us. We want to give our thanks to a loving instructor.
        </P>
