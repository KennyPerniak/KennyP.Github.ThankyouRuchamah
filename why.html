        <p>When you reconize the good she brings to people, why wouldn't we?
            There are reasons why we enjoy her lessons, is mainly her charisma and
            her character. She tell inspiring stories that gets us motivated, like
            a general giving out a speech before battle. We love those stories and
            we aspire to be like those who succeded. We want to take opportunities, we want to
            network, and we want to take lead. This simply wouldn't be possible without our BC
            instructor, Ruchamah.
