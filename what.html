        <p>Do you see the large sum of money that is accumulating in the page?
            This is the amonunt of money Ruchamah will help us earn because of her teachings.
            On a serious note, I find myself enjoying the time spent in her class, we all do.
            From the weekly Operations Managers, Interactives, and other activities. We built
            a better connection with each other, because of Ruchamah.
